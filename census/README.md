Book production figures from the Census of Manufactures

The 1935 census revises the figures for 1929, 1931, and 1933, so I have transcribed the figures for those years from the 1935 census. I only noticed this after transcribing the 1929 and 1931 figures from the 1931 census, so I have kept the other file on the off chance it is of interest somehow, but put it in an `unrevised` subdirectory.
